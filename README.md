## Hello!

I am currently studying web-design related topics and have found an interest in coding! Particularly, I enjoy the problem-solving aspects.
Outside of school and work, I love drawing, gaming, watching films (new and old!) and tending to the reptilian creatures occupying half my room.

Feel free to check out my CodePen profile as well -> ![see you there!](https://codepen.io/May-Giacinto):tada:
